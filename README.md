Python 3.10
Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib (pyplot)
Created with PyCharm.

This program generates images of 1D cellular automata patterns. 
Inspired by Lex Fridman's podcast with Prof. Stephen Wolfram, I thought that working on this small program would be a great way to train myself with numpy and pyplot. It is temporary, yet very interesting and inspiring, diversion from my DevOps interests. I am training my OOP skills, which is why I opted for this architecture, even though it is not so popular for use cases like plotting.
